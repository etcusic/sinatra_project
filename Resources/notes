NOTES

Desktop/Coding_Projects/Ruby/projects/flatiron_project2/sinatra_project

Areas to review/improve:
- Interact with DB via the command line and rake
- Use tux to test our app 
- Securing Passwords & User Authentication
    - #authenticate => Active Record (I think?)
- Mechanics of Sessions
    - Session_secret => environment variable?
    - bcrypt => salting & hashing
- CRUD architecture in Controllers
- What are RESTful routes => Respresentation State Transfer (convention of file/route structure)
- Actively change Class attributes with Active Record methods (ID problem)
- Seed users using faker

- Nested Forms?

TESTING:
[] CAN CREATE A NEW USER
[] Redirection if logged in/out
[] Cannot create new user with a username that already exists
[] Cannot create new user without username and password
[] User cannot edit/delete a page that is not their own
[] User cannot edit/delete a team that is not their own
[] Verify team before add/drop players
[] Team must have a full roster
[] User cannot create teams beyond max number (4 teams max per user)
[] User profiles look different than if not logged in as that user (foreign user profiles)
[] (*) required fields for "new" users/teams
[] Warnings for edit pages - insert current data into edit pages as well
[] Make sure sessions enabled after signup
[] Simplify code with class/instance methods
[] Schema - teams_table => logo / logo_url
[] Create new players
[] Nothing unused in Files - config.ru, Rakefile, etc
[] delete tables and reseed seeds.rb (without id assignment)

ERROR MESSAGES:
[] Sign up when already logged in
[] Trying to access user pages when not logged in
[] Trying to edit a different users page
[] Maximum number of teams has already been reached
[] 



user = User.create(:name => "Trisha", :username => "trisha@test", password: "password")


Views (all .erb files):
    |
    |---Owner
    |     |--- login
    |     |--- new (create a new owner)
    |     |--- show
    |     |--- edit
    |
    |---Vet
          |--- login
          |--- new (create a new vet)
          |--- show
          |--- edit

Controllers (Should be able to use same structure for both)
get '/login' do 
    erb :'owners/login'
end

post '/login' do 
    # code here
    redirect "/owners/#{ session[:user_id] }"
end

get '/owners/new' do 
    erb :'owners/new'
end

post '/owners' do 
    # code here
    redirect "owners/#{ session[:user_id] }"
end

get 'owners/:id' do  
    # code here
    erb :'owners/show'
end 

get 'owners/:id/edit' do
    # code here
    erb :'owners/edit'
end

patch 'owners/:id' do
    # code here
