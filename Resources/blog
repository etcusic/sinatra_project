Memoization: 
- Or-Equals Operator (||=) 
    - value ||= expensive_method(123)
    - ### logically equivalent to ###
    - value = (value || expensive_method(123))

- Put simply, memoization is saving a method's return value so it does not have to be recomputed each time. 
    As with all caching, you are effectively trading memory for time (i.e. you give up the memory required to store the value, 
    but you save the time required to process the method).
