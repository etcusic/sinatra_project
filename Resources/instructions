INSTRUCTIONS

1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your Sinatra application.

2. When you create the Sinatra app for your assessment, add the [spec.md] file from this repo to the 
    root directory of the project, commit it to Git and push it up to GitHub.

3. Build your application. Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful 
    (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit 
    that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins 
    of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit 
    is perfectly acceptable.

4. While you're working on it, record a 30 min coding session with your favorite screen capture tool. 
    During the session, either think out loud or not. It's up to you. You don't need to submit the video, 
    but we may ask for it at a later time.

5. Make sure to create a good README.md with a short description, install instructions, a contributor's guide, 
    and a link to the [license] for your code.

6. Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) 
    and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement *before* you submit your project.

7. Prepare a short video demo with narration describing how a user would interact with your working application.

8. Write a blog post about the project and process.

9. When done, submit your GitHub repo's URL, a link to your video demo, and a link to your blog post in 
    the corresponding text boxes in the right rail. Hit "I'm done" to wrap it up.
